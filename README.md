<h2> Issues Viewing on Github</h2>

This project is created using Jupyterlab and you may have issues rendering it with out installing Jupyterlab or issues rendering it on Github.
The message you may receive is...
"Sorry, something went wrong. Reload?" when viewing an *.ipynb on a GitHub blob page.

Probably a problem with the GitHub notebook viewing tool - sometimes github fails to render the ipynb notebooks

<h3>Workarounnd</h3>
Try to open that notebook that you want using nbviewer online, you don't need to install it.

Open "https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/"
Paste the link to your notebook


<h2>Install Jupyter Lab or Notebooks locally</h2>
In addition you can install Jupyterlab if you do not already have it.

You can find information here to install it...https://jupyter.org/install.html
I found this article to be a great resource on getting it installed with the pre-requisites for using Powershell with Jupyter....https://blog.darrenjrobinson.com/getting-started-with-local-powershell-jupyter-notebook/
